# Intellectual property
**Intellectual property** (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect.<br>
There are many types of **intellectual property**. The best-known types are **patents**, **copyrights**, **trademarks**, and **trade secrets**.<br>

<br>

# Copyright
**Copyright** is a **type of intellectual property** that **protects** original works of authorship as soon as an author fixes the work in a tangible form (physical form).<br>
**Joint authorship** of a **copyrightable** work is when two or more persons contribute enough to the work to be the author of that work.<br>
In the case of **joint authorship**, the authors share the **copyright** in the work with each other.<br>

<br>

**Copyright law** grants **five exclusive rights** to the owner of a copyrighted work.<br>
These include the right to:
- **distribute**;
- **reproduce**;
- **adapt**;
- **perform**;
- **publicly display** the protected work;

<br>

Infringement of the copyright occurs when one or more of these actions occur without the copyright owner's consent.<br>

<br>

Not all types of work can be copyrighted. A copyright does not protect **ideas**, **discoveries**, **concepts**, or **theories**. Brand names, logos, slogans, domain names, and titles also cannot be protected under copyright law.<br>

<br>

Companies, organizations, and other people besides the work’s creator can also be copyright owners. Copyright law allows ownership through **works made for hire**, which establishes that works created by an employee within the scope of employment are owned by the employer.<br>

<br>

It is important to know that **we are all also copyright users**.<br>
When we read books, watch movies, listen to music, or use videogames or software, we are using **copyright-protected works**.
So, even if you are not the owner of a work, you still may be able to use it. 

<br>

# Trademark law
**Trademark law** protect material that is used to distinguish an individual’s or corporation’s work from another entity.<Br>
What Is the difference between **copyright** and **trademark**? Both are ways or protecting intellectual property, but
- a **copyright protects a creator's original work** from being used or duplicated without their permission.
- a **trademark protects the reputation of a business** that is associated with identifying material such as their logo or slogan.
