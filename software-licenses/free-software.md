# Free software

A software is considered **free software** if its **users** have the **four essential freedoms** ([gnu](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#four-freedoms)):
1. The **freedom** to **run** the program **as you wish**, for **any purpose**.
2. The **freedom** to **study how the program works**, and **change it** so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
3. The **freedom** to **redistribute copies** to others.
4. The **freedom** to **distribute copies** of your **modified versions** to others.
