# Rosetta 2
**Rosetta 2** translates apps built for Intel so they will run on **Apple Silicon** (like the **M1 chip**).<br>
To the user, **Rosetta** is mostly **transparent**.<br>
If an executable contains **only** Intel instructions, macOS **automatically** launches **Rosetta** and begins the translation process.<br>
When translation finishes, the system launches the translated executable in place of the original.<br>
