# BSP
**Board Support Package** (**BSP**) is the layer of software containing hardware-specific drivers and other routines that allow a particular OS to function in a particular hardware environment.<br>
Third-party **hardware developers** who wish to support a particular OS must create a **BSP** that allows that OS to run on their platform.<br>
In most cases the **OS image** and **license**, the **BSP** containing it, and the **hardware** are **bundled together** by the **hardware vendor**.<br>

Most popular hardware architectures: `PowerPC`, `ARM`, `x86`, `MIPS`.
